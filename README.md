# Weather-Analysis

In this project, I collect data from the National Weather Service at https://www.weather.gov/wrh/Climate?wfo=mfl and use the Seaborn library to perform a linear regression analysis to predict the average temperature in Miami and Panama City on Christmas Day, 2021. Visualizations and Source Code can be seen on "Weather Prediction.ipynb".
